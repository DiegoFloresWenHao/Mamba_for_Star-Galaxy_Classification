# Mamba for Star Galaxy Classification

Mamba: is a new state space model architecture showing promising performance on information-dense data such as language modeling, where previous subquadratic models fall short of Transformers. It is based on the line of progress on structured state space models, with an efficient hardware-aware design and implementation in the spirit of FlashAttention. https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752

Welcome to Mamba, a sophisticated repository leveraging the State Space Model to classify stars and galaxies using an astronomical dataset. This project not only opens the gates to cosmic exploration but also challenges the frontiers of computer vision in astronomical research.

# 📌 Overview

This repository implements the State Space Model to classify stellar sources such as stars and galaxies. The dataset utilized for this project was made open-source by the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital, India, using their in-house 1.3m telescope. This github repository uses the code given by the paper "MedMamba: Vision Mamba for Medical Image Classification" https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03849

For a complete and well detailed presentation of Mamba's training and testing please refer to this Kaggle Notebook https://www.kaggle.com/code/diegoexe/mamba-for-star-galaxy-classification-91-45-acc
